ModernizePluginForJava8,https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/jenkins/modernizepluginforjava8,"This recipe is intended to break down the modernization of very old plugins into distinct steps. It allows modernizing all tooling up to the last versions that supported Java 8. This can then be followed by another recipe that makes the jump to Java 11.","mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:RELEASE -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8"
Java8toJava11,https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/java8tojava11,"This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when upgrading to Java 11. Specifically, for those applications that are built on Java 8, this recipe will update and add dependencies on J2EE libraries that are no longer directly bundled with the JDK. This recipe will also replace deprecated API with equivalents when there is a clear migration strategy. Build files will also be updated to use Java 11 as the target/source and plugins will be also be upgraded to versions that are compatible with Java 11.","mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:RELEASE -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.migrate.Java8toJava11"
